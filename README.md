# FeatherMe
FeatherMe is a penguin you can keep in your pocket! It will always be by your side, but your penguin must be fed three times a day, given a nap once a day, and cuddled four times a day! If you donâ€™t care for it properly, your penguin will die.

You can only reset your penguin three times, or you will run out of penguins and not be able to reset!
Stay loyal to your penguin, and your penguin will love you forever and always await your return! 

Complete with a cute and user-friendly interface, FeatherMe makes interacting with your penguin easy and fun!
